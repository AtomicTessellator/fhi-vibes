FK: should the database know which parameters have been ignores?
FK: List of things that might go to database as well:
  - No. of scf steps
FK: Places where ase should be able to handle file objects insteas of strings:
  - MD(trajectory=...)
  - Aims(species_dir=...
FK: It would be neat if atoms.calc.write(..) would accept a directory to write the files to
  -> I added a cd() that can change directory intermediately (in helpers.paths)
TP: All data structures that go into the database need to have some standardized/reversible method to convert it into a database acceptable data format. We should try to standardize the data types to make this easier
FK: f2py is blind to optional values! (defaults to 0)
