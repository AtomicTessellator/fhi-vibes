A diverse set of stakeholders{\^a}??representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers{\^a}??have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

abstract = {Low thermal conductivity materials are crucial for applications such as thermoelectric conversion of waste heat to useful energy and thermal barrier coatings. On the other hand, high thermal conductivity materials are necessary for cooling electronic devices. However, search for such materials via explicit evaluation of thermal conductivity either experimentally or computationally is very challenging. Here, we carried out high-throughput ab initio calculations, on a dataset containing 195 binary, ternary, and quaternary compounds. The lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa$l values of 120 dynamically stable and nonmetallic compounds are calculated, which span over 3 orders of magnitude. Among these, 11 ultrahigh and 15 ultralow $\kappa$l materials are identified. An analysis of generated property map of this dataset reveals a strong dependence of $\kappa$l on simple descriptors, namely, maximum phonon frequency, integrated Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter up to 3 THz, average atomic mass, and volume of the unit cell. Using these descriptors, a Gaussian process regression-based machine learning (ML) model is developed. The model predicts log-scaled $\kappa$l with a very small root mean square error of ∼0.21. Comparatively, the Slack model, which uses more involved parameters, severely overestimates $\kappa$l. The superior performance of our ML model can ensure a reliable and accelerated search for multitude of low and high thermal conductivity materials.},

abstract = {High-throughput, low-cost, and accurate predictions of thermal properties of new materials would be beneficial in fields ranging from thermal barrier coatings and thermoelectrics to integrated circuits. To date, computational efforts for predicting lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa$L) have been hampered by the complexity associated with computing multiple phonon interactions. In this work, we develop and validate a semiempirical model for $\kappa$L by fitting density functional theory calculations to experimental data. Experimental values for $\kappa$L come from new measurements on SrIn2O4, Ba2SnO4, Cu2ZnSiTe4, MoTe2, Ba3In2O6, Cu3TaTe4, SnO, and InI as well as 55 compounds from across the published literature. To capture the anharmonicity in phonon interactions, we incorporate a structural parameter that allows the model to predict $\kappa$L within a factor of 1.5 of the experimental value across 4 orders of magnitude in $\kappa$L values and over a diverse chemical and structural phase space, with accuracy similar to or better than that of computationally more expensive models.},

While solution grown specimens all display the well-known monoclinic structure widely reported in the literature, by varying the growth conditions two more polymorphs have been obtained, either from the melt or by sublimation. By injecting water as a nonsolvent in a DPA solution, one of the two new polymorphs was predominantly obtained in the shape of microribbons. Lattice energy calculations allow us to assess the relative thermodynamic stability of the polymorphs and verify that the energies of the different phases are very sensitive to the details of the molecular geometry adopted in the solid state. The mobility channels of DPA polymorphs are shortly investigated.},

Nevertheless, because of modern synthesis and characterization techniques, particularly for nanoscale materials, a new era of complex thermoelectric materials is approaching.

abstract = {The lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa$L) is a critical property of thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coating materials and semiconductors. While accurate empirical measurements of $\kappa$L are extremely challenging, it is usually approximated through computational approaches, such as semi-empirical models, Green-Kubo formalism coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, and first-principles based methods. However, these theoretical methods are not only limited in terms of their accuracy, but sometimes become computationally intractable owing to their cost. Thus, in this work, we build a machine learning (ML)-based model to accurately and instantly predict $\kappa$L of inorganic materials, using a benchmark data set of experimentally measured $\kappa$L of about 100 inorganic materials. We use advanced and universal feature engineering techniques along with the Gaussian process regression algorithm, and compare the performance of our ML model with past theoretical works. The trained ML model is not only helpful for rational design and screening of novel materials, but we also identify key features governing the thermal transport behavior in non-metals.},
