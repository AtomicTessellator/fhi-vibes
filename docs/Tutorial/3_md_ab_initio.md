# _ab initio_ Modeling

!!! info
	We will now introduce _ab initio_ Molecular Dynamics simulations where the atomic forces come from a first-principles code. We will use `FHI-aims` as this calculator in the following. We assume:

	- You have familiarized yourself with running MD simulations with FHI-vibes for the LJ-Argon toy model. 
	- You are familiar with running `FHI-aims` calculations on a supercomputer.
